## 🧠 AI & Algorithms Projects

### 🗺️ AI Pathfinding on Real-World Road Networks
Year 2 AI coursework implementing and benchmarking multiple search algorithms on OpenStreetMap road networks.

- Implemented **A\***, **BFS**, **DFS**, **Bidirectional MM**, and **logic-constrained A\*** for route planning
- Used **OSMnx** and **NetworkX** to model graphs with thousands of nodes and edges
- Analysed performance across execution time, nodes explored, path quality, and memory usage
- Implemented bidirectional MM based on peer-reviewed research to significantly reduce search space

> Focus: search algorithms, heuristics, complexity analysis, and real-world optimisation.
